# ReactSnips

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this project?

I built this simple code snippet forum with a server and front-end for a university web development course.

This project, as it stands, doesn't take into account:
Markup: * Bullet list
            * ease of deployment
            * ease of use
            * express or react conventions

# A non-exhaustive list of easy future source code improvements:
Markup: *

        * many functions in the back-end could be extracted to reduce code repetetiveness.
        
        * using props to make a more sensible general-use form component
    
        * build a database abstraction layer to make code less verbose
        
        * improved mongoose schemas, possibly even gaining performance


## Available Scripts

In the root directory the following custom commands are available:



### Front-end dependencies

react-syntax-highlighter
    It's very easy to use and is made for use with React.

### Back-end dependencies

## installation

This guide relies on you having git installed. 
```bash
git clone 
cd 
```

### `Link example`
Link: [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
